Over the past few weeks, I've had the incredible opportunity to participate in the CodSoft internship program, where I've had the chance to dive deep into various projects and tasks, honing my skills and gaining valuable experience along the way.

Here are the 5 tasks I completed during the internship:

1️⃣ [Number Guess Game]: In this program a random number between 1-100 is genrated by program and user have to guess the number.

2️⃣ [Grade Calculator]: In this program it takes input from the user (marks of student) and then the program will show the average marks , percentage and Grades.

3️⃣ [Currency Converter]: In this program i use API which fetch the current exchange rates and when user enter the price it will convert it in desired currency.

4️⃣ [ATM]: A simple ATM interface for the user where he can check the current balance , deposit , withdraw amount.

5️⃣ [Student Mangement System]: This program is like a small database of student where it stores student data (name , rollno. ,father's name , grades) And have some methods to add or remove or searching a student and show all students.


Each task presented its own unique challenges, but I'm proud to say that I tackled them head-on and grew both personally and professionally in the process.
